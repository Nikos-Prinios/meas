1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:06,600
What I like about farming is growing things.

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,760
And as a farmer, you don't get many years.

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,240
Every year is a crop year.

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,800
And so if you're lucky, you might start,

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,620
when I was lucky,

6
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:23,640
because I started farming when I was 16, 17.

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,800
And if you're lucky, you might get 40,

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,360
or maybe if you're really lucky,

9
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,160
you'll get 50 goes at it.

10
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:36,160
So every year is a challenge to grow a really good crop

11
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,640
and to breed good sheep and to improve all the time.

12
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,240
And of course you get setbacks,

13
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,400
you get, you got a crop looking beautiful

14
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,640
and then the drought comes along

15
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,840
and you don't get much grain

16
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,320
or you get a frost and it's gone.

17
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,680
But it's a challenge.

18
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,240
You're always striving to do better

19
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:59,200
and to just build an enterprise

20
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,880
and make room for my sons to come home.

21
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,200
I suppose it's just a passion.

22
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:08,200
You just, just want to build a good enterprise

23
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,240
and you want to do the best all the time.

24
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,400
When you own your own land,

25
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:20,320
I think you have a feeling that you own something

26
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,720
or you belong to something.

27
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,360
It's part of you.

28
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,080
And we don't like to see the land blowing away.

29
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,360
We don't like to see too much rain where it's flooding.

30
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,520
It is, it becomes, your land becomes a part of you.

31
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,440
And I suppose I've said it before,

32
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,240
but it's just a passion you've got.

33
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,840
And some people, they have a farm and then they sell it

34
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,480
and then they go, off they go,

35
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,200
they retire, move to the city.

36
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,360
I am not a city dweller.

37
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,040
I just like the open spaces.

38
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,840
I like the freedom.

39
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,040
You can get up in the morning

40
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,520
and you haven't got your neighbour yelling

41
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,320
and you don't hear any noise.

42
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,960
And you might hear a dog barking in the distance

43
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,960
or a sheep bleating or a cow, or you've got the wind.

44
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,520
It's just a freedom that you've got.

45
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,080
And it's your own land.

46
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,920
And the more you do and the harder you work,

47
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,520
the more successful you become.

48
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,760
And when I had no money, money seemed to be important.

49
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,600
And now we're successful and we've got money.

50
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,560
It's nowhere near as important.

51
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,040
Improving it and having the best

52
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,760
and having it really neat and tidy

53
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,360
is more important than anything.

54
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,200
Well, the day that we,

55
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,800
the sheep story, we start at the beginning

56
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,800
because it became a gradual thing.

57
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,560
We worked out that the sheep price crashed

58
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,080
and we were all wondering,

59
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,880
what are we gonna do with our sheep?

60
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,880
But so it was at over a period of two or three months,

61
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,640
we all came to the realisation

62
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,600
that the sheep couldn't be sold.

63
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,240
And we kept hoping and hoping

64
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,720
that somebody would buy the sheep.

65
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,720
And it was like a,

66
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,000
cutting your leg off with a blunt saw.

67
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,880
And because it became ineffable

68
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,840
that we would have to shoot the sheep.

69
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,640
And it was a very sad day.

70
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,080
They were yarded and we had a big pit alongside

71
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,840
and I helped my neighbour and my neighbour helped me.

72
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,640
So you systematically went through with the rifle,

73
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,760
bang, bang, bang, and you were just shooting the sheep.

74
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,600
And then we were just dragging them

75
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,640
and tipping them over the side of the pit.

76
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,840
It was horrible, it was horrendous.

77
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,800
And, you know, blood and shooting sheep

78
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,160
and, but there was no option.

79
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:52,480
You couldn't sell them and you couldn't give them away.

80
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,920
So you had no option.

81
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,720
And it was a job that had to be done.

82
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,640
You did it and you got on with it.

83
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,440
And it was terrible, but you just got on with it.

84
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,240
And the next day we put the dirt across the top.

85
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,560
And when you drive past, I suppose you say,

86
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,880
I remember that, that patch of dirt

87
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,160
was all my beautiful sheep in it.

88
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:18,240
I suppose we shed a tear, I can't really remember.

89
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:23,360
If I had to talk about something that was successful

90
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,400
or a day that was enjoyable

91
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,160
or something that I did in my life that was meaningful

92
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,760
would have to be when my shearer,

93
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:38,680
who was sure for me for 20 years, was my friend

94
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,080
and he was dying of motor neuron disease.

95
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,800
I asked him what would make him happy.

96
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,480
And he said, if I was taken for a drive

97
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,360
and I could see all the old sheds

98
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,720
where I shore my sheep in.

99
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,240
And so I collected two friends and a vehicle and some beers

100
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,200
and we went round and we drove him around in his last days

101
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,640
to all the sheds he shore in.

102
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,360
And we got to Lammeroo and we said to Mid,

103
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,120
his name was Mid Trowbridge,

104
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,560
we said to Mid, what do you want for lunch?

105
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,200
And he said, I want a Chico roll and chips.

106
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,280
And that was something just so simple

107
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,560
and he just enjoyed it and it was just a fantastic day.

108
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,560
He was just, he lifted from his despair of knowing

109
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,720
that his days were numbered

110
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,960
and he just had a fantastic day

111
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,680
and it made us all feel good that we were with him

112
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,080
and we never mentioned the fact that he was dying.

113
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,200
It was just, we were just with him

114
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,640
and we were happy to be with him and for him.

115
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,480
It was a good day.
